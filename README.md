# Number Wizard UI

This is the UI version of Number Wizard.
A game where the player thinks of a number between 1 and 1000, and the computer will guess it!

This was a project from the [GameDev.TV](https://www.gamedev.tv/) course on [Unity 2D](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/learn-c-sharp-unity-developer-2d-for-video-game-development).
